Our company's Virtual Meeting Rooms do not support meetings in Virtual Reality (yet), but they have a lot of the same things that you would expect to find in a physical meeting room, apart from walls and furniture.

People can book a Virtual Meeting Room on their calendar and invite other people to join them there.
When everyone is in the room, they can see and hear each other as well as display presentations and collaborate on documents using their computers or tablets.

It will look slightly different inside a Virtual Meeting Room depending on what type of interface you use, but here is a basic sketch:
