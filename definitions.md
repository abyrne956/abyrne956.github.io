A Room System connects your meeting room to video calls with other meeting rooms using high quality cameras, microphones and a specialized type of computer (sold by companies like Cisco, Tandberg, Polycom and Lifesize) that processes video very quickly but does not access the internet the way that other computers do, and cannot normally communicate with personal computers, tablets or smart phones unless it starts by connecting to a [Virtual Meeting Room](#virtual-meeting-room).

Skype for Business is a Microsoft Office program used for secure video and chat conversations between an organization’s employees, which has been specially set up by CompanyX IT with the ability to access CompanyX’s [Virtual Meeting Rooms](#virtual-meeting-room) through the internal contact list, and has security settings that prevent it from communicating with accounts made using the free (“normal”) version of Skype.
