## Conference ID

A conference ID is a short string of numbers used to identify and connect to a specific [Virtual Meeting Room](#virtual-meeting-room).

## IP

An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a string of numbers separated by dots, similar to a phone number, that identifies a specific location in a computer network and can be dialed using a [Room System](#room-system)’s remote control or number pad to start a video call.

## Room System

A Room System connects your meeting room to video calls with other meeting rooms using high quality cameras, microphones and a specialized type of computer (sold by companies like Cisco, Tandberg, Polycom and Lifesize) that processes video very quickly but does not access the internet the way that other computers do, and cannot normally communicate with personal computers, tablets or smart phones unless it starts by connecting to a [Virtual Meeting Room](#virtual-meeting-room).

## Skype for Business

Skype for Business is a Microsoft Office program used for secure video and chat conversations between an organization’s employees, which has been specially set up by CompanyX IT with the ability to access CompanyX’s [Virtual Meeting Rooms](#virtual-meeting-room) through the internal contact list, and has security settings that prevent it from communicating with accounts made using the free (“normal”) version of Skype.

## CompanyX registered endpoint

CompanyX registered endpoints are [Room System](#room-system)s that can be contacted using a [URI](#uri) provided by CompanyX, mostly located at the Vancouver campus, the Okanagan campus and many hospital sites where CompanyX employees have offices.

## URI

A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) is a string of letters, numbers and symbols, similar to an email address, that identifies a specific location in a computer network and can be typed into a [Room System](#room-system) or a desktop/web/mobile app to start a video call.

## Virtual Meeting Room

A Virtual Meeting Room creates a middle ground where you can bring together communication devices that used to be hard to connect to each other, including personal computers, [Room System](#room-system)s, tablets, smart phones and landline phones.
