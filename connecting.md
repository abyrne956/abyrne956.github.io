Each [Virtual Meeting Room](#virtual-meeting-room) is accessed using its unique [Conference ID](#conference-id) number.

In most cases this is a two-step process very similar to joining a conference call or dialing someone’s extension on the phone.
If you join by phone for an audio-only connection, it’s exactly the same process. On a computer it’s easy to see the similarities.

First you contact the central directory (opening the app or website), then you add specific information about where you want your call to be connected.

For someone using a [CompanyX registered endpoint](#companyx-registered-endpoint), it’s even possible to dial in with just the [Conference ID](#conference-id) for a CompanyX [Virtual Meeting Room](#virtual-meeting-room), like dialling a colleague’s extension on a shared office phone system without having to enter their full phone number.

The technology may look new, but as you get to know it you'll find that it’s still used in very familiar ways.
